# Easy PBR Hook
Powerful PBR Hook tool. (description)
# Guide
- **Installation**<br />
  Install script to Blender. Go to Edit->Preferences->Add-ons->Install...<br />
  Choose Easy_PBR_Hook_x_x_x.py, click "Install Add-on" and enable it.<br />
  Now, in your Material Properties you have Easy PBR Hook Panel.<br />
- **Usage**<br />
  Go to the material tab of your model, select a material you want to set up. Scroll down to Easy PBR Hook section. 

  Paste or select a path to the texture folder.
  
  If there are multiple texture sets in said folder you can use the Keyword field to determine which texture set will be used. 
  
  Click Assign textures button. You're done.
  
If your textures are as messy as mine you could have MetalSmoothness, OcclusionRoughnessMetallic, Metallic and Roughness maps in the same folder.
If that's the case Easy PBR Hook will choose one of those and create a full set up. If you want to use another Pipeline you can do so via
'Change Pipeline' button. 

Use Texture Properties and Texture Coordinates drop-downs to further set up the look of your material.
